# proxsox
proxy server in c using sockets and openssl

requests to localhost:8080 will return the response of a get request to smu.edu

## quickstart
_assuming you have docker installed on your computer_
```
docker build -t proxsox .
docker run -it --rm --name run -p 8080:8080 proxsox
```

this will start the server listening on port 8080, then follow the onscreen
prompts for any other info

## how to run
since i have a windows computer, development and testing has been done using
docker, and so i've included the dockerfile necessary to run and build the program.

but if you have gcc, libssl-dev, and the ability to use a Makefile, you should
be able to build locally without an issue.

if that doesn't work then **please use the docker environment**

### local build
If you have make, then you can just use the included Makefile. Simply run `make`
and then run the executable as `./proxsox` and you should be good to go.

### docker build
If you don't want to build the application locally, then you can also run in
docker.

First, build the container with 

```docker build -t proxsox .```


Then, you can run the container with 

```docker run -it --rm --name run -p 8080:8080 proxsox```
